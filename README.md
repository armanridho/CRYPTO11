Crypto++: a C++ Class Library of Cryptographic


----- This library includes: -----

MD5, SHS, DES, IDEA, WAKE, RC4, RC5,
Blowfish, Diamond, Diamond Lite, Sapphire, Luby-Rackoff, MDC, various 
modes (CFB, CBC, OFB, counter), DH, RSA, DSA, ElGamal, BBS, gzip 
compression, Shamir's secret sharing scheme, Rabin's information 
dispersal scheme, and zero-knowledge prover and verifier for
graph isomorphism.  There are also various miscellanous modules such 
as base 64 coding and 32-bit CRC.

It has been compiled and tested with Borland C++ 4.5, MSVC 2.1, 
and G++ 2.6.3 on MS-DOS, Windows NT, and a variety of Unix machines.
You are welcome to use it for any purpose without paying me, but see
license.txt for the fine print.

           
Some short instructions to compile this library:
(you probably need to modify this to suit your environment)


-- if want to use this library with RSAREF, then :
1. get a copy of RSAREF

2. untar or unzip it into a directory below this one

3. type "gcc -c -I. *.c" (in the rsaref/source directory) to compile RSAREF

4. edit config.h

5. type "g++ -c -Irsaref/source -I. *.cpp" to compile this library

6. type "g++ *.o rsaref/source/*.o -lg++ -lm" to link the test driver

7. type "a.out" to run the test driver


-- if you DON'T want to use this library with RSAREF, then :

1. edit config.h (make sure to comment out #define USE_RSAREF)

2. type "g++ -c *.cpp" to compile this library

3. type "g++ *.o -lg++ -lm" to link the test driver

4. type "a.out" to run the test driver


Finally, a note on object ownership:  If a constructor for A takes 
a pointer to an object B (except primitive types such as int and char), then 
A owns B and will delete B at A's destruction.  If a 
constructor for A takes a reference to an object B, then 
the caller retains ownership of B and should not destroy it until A no longer 
needs it.
